To-Do:
-Aesthetic appeal on saved search page
-Get saved searches to show up after typing in a search and hitting submit
  (they show up when first coming to the page and by clicking the search button
   on the menu bar and when navigating by clicking on the tags of images that
   are shown. Just not when clicking submit and searching that way)
